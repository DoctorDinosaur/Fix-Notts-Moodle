# Fix-Notts-Moodle
Make Moodle Less ðŸ’©

Hacked together in an hour. It's a better idea to use something like [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) for the theme changes, but I already use uBlock. Moodle is using Bootstrap for its theming, so there's prob a much easier way.

Fetches updates every 4 days. If something looks broke, you might need to force an update in ublock settings if it's already fixed here.

## Install
Also, be sure to go to the moodle homepage -> Edit Mode in the top right -> add back Module Overview.
### Manually
- Go to uBlock settings
- Go to Filter Lists
- Scroll to bottom -> Import...
- Enter url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoctorDinosaur/Fix-Notts-Moodle/main/Fix-Notts-Moodle.txt

(Optional layout only version is here too, incase you _like_ the new colours)

### Automatically
Click the link on https://doctordinosaur.github.io/Fix-Notts-Moodle/

*Why github pages?*: uBlock has a [hardcoded](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/d0dbc27c025b894bdc5cf32d501a1aaf36725b07/platform/firefox/manifest.json#L60) list of domains that can have a filter list url. Github markdown doesn't support protocol links
