# Fix-Notts-Moodle
Make Moodle Less ðŸ’©

Hacked together in an hour. It's a better idea to use something like [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) for the theme changes, but I already use uBlock.

## Install
- Go to uBlock settings
- Go to Filter Lists
- Scroll to bottom -> Import...
- Enter url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoctorDinosaur/Fix-Notts-Moodle/main/Fix-Notts-Moodle.txt
